# Technical task for research engineer position

1. [Find the python code](provider/provider.py) that can be used to generate prices for a preset list of financial instruments. The code needs to be packed and deployed to an existing orchestration system. We are expecting a CICD pipeline for packaging the container, validation, and itâ€™s deployment. 

2. Write a client code that will be connecting to the service described in point 1, and collect generated data, for storage. Feel free to use any storage medium. Once again we are expecting a CICD pipeline for managing software delivery lifecycle.

3. Expose an endpoint for the service monitoring. Specify a set of metrics to ensure stable work of the solution.

4. Update repo with approprite documentation.
